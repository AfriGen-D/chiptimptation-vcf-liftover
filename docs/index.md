## Quick Start â€‹

Get started with chiptimputation-vcf-liftover in just a few commands:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AfriGen-D/chiptimputation-vcf-liftover.git
cd chiptimputation-liftover

```

## What chiptimputation-vcf-liftover Does â€‹

This Nextflow pipeline provides:

- **Coordinate Conversion**: Lifts over genomic coordinates from hg19 to hg38 using CrossMap
- **Smart Processing**: Automatically handles VCF sorting, indexing, and chromosome renaming
- **Quality Assessment**: Comprehensive statistics and validation reports
- **Multi-File Support**: Process multiple VCF files simultaneously with CSV batch input
